            I am a 4th-year student of Mathematical and Mechanical Faculty (BSU)
            embarking on my journey in the IT field. While I focus on
            mathematics and algorithms in my studies, I am particularly
            interested in web development, seeking frameworks and technologies
            that simplify coding. I primarily utilize Python and C# for my
            personal projects and am currently delving into Java. I have also
            ventured into app development using ASP.NET Core with the MVC
            pattern. Furthermore, I have experience in modernizing an
            application built on an older version of .NET Framework. I migrated
            it to Node.js, implemented React for creating visual components, and
            utilized Express.js for the server. I also integrated a PostgreSQL
            database. This application, designed for educational institutions,
            is undergoing further modifications. Moreover, this year, I
            developed an application for automatic school schedule generation
            using a genetic algorithm. I also honed my design skills by creating
            landing pages in Figma and familiarized myself with Adobe
            Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.

                    This game was created using Windows Forms and C/C++. The
                    idea is to find all pair pictures on the selected topic
                    during the fixed time. Right after the user has found all
                    the pair pictures, he recieves bonuses and goes to the next
                    level, otherwise he is defeated. The game implements
                    role-based authorization; Microsoft SQL Server Database is
                    connected too

                    Web application built using the Python framework Django,
                    designed to automatically generate school schedules. The
                    application employs a genetic algorithm to create the most
                    optimal schedule based on given norms, rules, and
                    requirements. Additionally, it verifies that the generated
                    schedule complies with the set norms and requirements. The
                    application features an adaptive, simple, and user-friendly
                    interface. Future plans include the integration of AI tools

                    Landing project "Burgers" based on a Figma layout and
                    implemented on the Angular framework. All burgers data is
                    received from the server. Also, when ordering a burger, the
                    data is also sent to the server and processed. What's more
                    the landing gives the opportunity to change the currency of
                    a burger you order: dollar, euro, yuan, Russian ruble,
                    Belarusian ruble. Thus, the burger price changes according
                    to the exchange rate. The project was made during the
                    frontend intensive in online school Itlogia

                    One of the landing pages I created in Figma, intended for
                    advertising a wedding dresses store. Landing has 3 main
                    screens, header and footer. Also, a similar landing page
                    design was created for the mobile version of the wedding
                    store
